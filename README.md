Platanus Angular RUT
===============

An Angular module with several components to handle Chilean RUT validation, cleaning and formatting. It includes:

- **ngRut**: a directive to easily add validation, cleaning and formatting to any element with an associated ```ng-model``` value
- **rut**: a filter to format valid RUTs with dots and dashes (11.111.111-1) in the view
- **RutHelper**: a constant you can inject in your modules and exposes individual methods for validation, cleaning and formatting.

## Installation

*Just use [Bower](http://bower.io/)*.

```
bower install angular-rut --save
```

Then, inject it into your application:

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp', ['platanus.rut']);
```

## Directive

Add the ```ng-rut``` directive to any element with an associated ```ng-model``` to automatically perform validation, cleaning and formatting.

```html
<input ng-rut type="text" ng-model="model.rut">
```
The directive does the following:

- It **validates** whether the input is a valid RUT (by using ```$setValidity```),
- passes a **clean** RUT (numbers and K only) to the model,
- and **formats** the view by adding dots and dashes (11.111.111-1).

#### Options

You can use the ```rut-format``` attribute to define when should the view be formatted:

- ```live```: Format as the RUT changes (e.g. as a user types into the input):
```html
<input ng-rut rut-format="live" type="text">
```

- ```blur```: Format when the input is blurred:
```html
<input ng-rut rut-format="blur" type="text">
```


## Filter

Use it just like any Angular filter. It takes a (presumably valid) RUT, cleans and formats it.

```html
{{ model.rut | rut }} 
```

## RutHelper

Inject it as a dependency anywhere you like:

```javascript
app.controller('RutCtrl', ['RutHelper', function(RutHelper){ ...
```

Then use it like so:

```javascript
RutHelper.format('111111111'); // returns 11.111.111-1
```

There are three methods available:

- ```RutHelper.clean(rut)``` strips every character except numbers and the letter K.
- ```RutHelper.format(rut)``` cleans and formats the RUT number with dots and dashes (e.g 11.111.111-1).
- ```RutHelper.validate(rut)``` returns a boolean indicating whether the given RUT is valid.
